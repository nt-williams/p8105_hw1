P8105 Homework 1
================

Problem 1
---------

``` r
set.seed(1)

df_p1 <- tibble(
  vec_numeric = runif(10, 0, 5), 
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 2, 
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k"), 
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "female", "male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male"))
)
```

``` r
mean(df_p1$vec_numeric)
```

    ## [1] 2.757569

``` r
mean(df_p1$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.6

``` r
mean(df_p1$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df_p1$vec_char): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(df_p1$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df_p1$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

I am able to take the mean of the numeric and logical vector. However, I cannot take the mean of the character or factor vector; when I try an error is returned indicating the argument is not numeric or logical. I'm assuming I can take the mean of a logical vector because R internally represents false as 0 and true as 1.

``` r
as.numeric(df_p1$vec_logical)
as.numeric(df_p1$vec_char)
as.numeric(df_p1$vec_factor)
```

When I convert the logical vector to numeric a vector of 0 and 1s is returned, confirming my suspicion about R's internal representation of logical values. For the character vector, NAs are returned when I try to convert the vector to numeric. When I convert the factor vector to numeric a vector of 1s and 2s are returned. I believe these correspond to the 1st and the 2nd level of the factor respectively.

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(df_p1$vec_char))
as.numeric(as.character(df_p1$vec_factor))
```

When I convert the character vector to a factor and then to a numeric vector a vector of values ranging from 1:10 are returned. This represent R first factoring the 10 character values and then returning the levels of the factor when coerced to numeric. NAs are returned when I convert the factor vector to character and then to numeric. This is becuase R is unable to convert character values to numeric.

Problem 2
---------

``` r
set.seed(1)

df_p2 <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000), 
  y = rnorm(1000), 
  vec_logical = x + y > 0, 
  vec_numeric = as.numeric(vec_logical), 
  vec_factor = factor(vec_numeric)
)
```
