P8105 Homework 1
================

Problem 1
---------

``` r
df_p1 <- tibble(
  vec_numeric = runif(10, 0, 5), 
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 2, 
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k"), 
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "female", "male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male"))
)
```

``` r
mean(df_p1$vec_numeric)
```

    ## [1] 2.547428

``` r
mean(df_p1$vec_logical)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(df_p1$vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df_p1$vec_char): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(df_p1$vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(df_p1$vec_factor): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

I am able to take the mean of the numeric and logical vector. However, I cannot take the mean of the character or factor vector; when I try an error is returned indicating the argument is not numeric or logical. I'm assuming I can take the mean of a logical vector because R internally represents false as 0 and true as 1.
