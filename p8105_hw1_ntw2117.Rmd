## Problem 1

```{r problem 1 dataframe}

set.seed(1)

df_p1 <- tibble(
  vec_numeric = runif(10, 0, 5), 
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 2, 
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k"), 
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "female", "male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male"))
)

```

```{r means}

mean(df_p1$vec_numeric)
mean(df_p1$vec_logical)
mean(df_p1$vec_char)
mean(df_p1$vec_factor)

```

I am able to take the mean of the numeric and logical vector. However, I cannot take the mean of the character or factor vector; when I try an error is returned indicating the argument is not numeric or logical. I'm assuming I can take the mean of a logical vector because R internally represents false as 0 and true as 1. 

```{r converting practice 1, eval = FALSE}

as.numeric(df_p1$vec_logical)
as.numeric(df_p1$vec_char)
as.numeric(df_p1$vec_factor)

```

When I convert the logical vector to numeric a vector of 0 and 1s is returned, confirming my suspicion about R's internal representation of logical values. For the character vector, NAs are returned when I try to convert the vector to numeric. When I convert the factor vector to numeric a vector of 1s and 2s are returned. I believe these correspond to the 1st and the 2nd level of the factor respectively. 

```{r converting practice 2, eval = FALSE}

as.numeric(as.factor(df_p1$vec_char))
as.numeric(as.character(df_p1$vec_factor))

```

When I convert the character vector to a factor and then to a numeric vector a vector of values ranging from 1:10 are returned. This represent R first factoring the 10 character values and then returning the levels of the factor when coerced to numeric. NAs are returned when I convert the factor vector to character and then to numeric. This is becuase R is unable to convert character values to numeric. 

## Problem 2

```{r problem 2 dataframe}

set.seed(1)

df_p2 <- tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000), 
  y = rnorm(1000), 
  vec_logical = x + y > 0, 
  vec_numeric = as.numeric(vec_logical), 
  vec_factor = factor(vec_numeric)
)

```

### Dataframe description

Dataframe, df_p2, has size `r nrow(df_p2)` rows and `r ncol(df_p2)` columns. The mean of vector x is `r mean(df_p2$x)` and the median is `r median(df_p2$x)`. The proportion of cases for which vec_logical = TRUE is `r sum(as.numeric(df_p2$vec_logical)) / 1000`.

```{r scatter plot one}

color_logical <- ggplot(
  df_p2, aes(x = x, y = y, color = vec_logical)) +
  geom_point()

print(color_logical)

```

```{r scatter plot two}

color_numeric <- ggplot(
  df_p2, aes(
    x = x, 
    y = y, 
    color = vec_numeric)) +
  geom_point()

print(color_numeric)

```

```{r scatter plot three}

color_factor <- ggplot(
  df_p2, aes(
    x = x, 
    y = y, 
    color = vec_factor)) + 
  geom_point()
  
print(color_factor)

```

```{r saving color_logical}

ggsave("plots/scatter_plot_logical.pdf", 
       height = 4, width = 6)
