```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

```{r create_dataframe}

df_p1 <- tibble(
  vec_numeric = runif(10, 0, 5), 
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 2, 
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k"), 
  vec_factor = factor(c("male", "female", "male", "female", "female", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male"))
)

```

```{r means}

mean(df_p1$vec_numeric)
mean(df_p1$vec_logical)
mean(df_p1$vec_char)
mean(df_p1$vec_factor)

```

I am able to take the mean of the numeric and logical vector. However, I cannot take the mean of the character or factor vector; when I try an error is returned indicating the argument is not numeric or logical. I'm assuming I can take the mean of a logical vector because R internally represents false as 0 and true as 1.
